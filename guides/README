Put quick start / cheat sheet guides in this directory.

The first part of the guide should be the absolute minimum you need to 
actually do the thing.

Then ideally a list of common problems and solutions.

Then any additional supplement information.

Each time you can't figure out how to do something you need, add that thing
to the FAQ.

Eschew verbiage.
